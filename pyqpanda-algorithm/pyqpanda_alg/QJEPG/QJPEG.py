class QJPEG:
    """
    Quantum JPEG (QJPEG) image down-sampling / compression.

    The QJPEG algorithm encodes an image patch into the amplitudes of a quantum
    state (QPIE, Quantum Probability Image Encoding), applies the quantum Fourier
    transform to move to the spatial-frequency domain, discards the high
    spatial-frequency qubits, and transforms back. Reading out the measurement
    probabilities of the remaining qubits yields a lower-resolution image, in the
    same spirit as the classical JPEG that filters high-frequency components [1].

    The image is first split into square ``patch_size`` x ``patch_size`` patches.
    Each patch is processed independently by a ``2 * log2(patch_size)`` qubit
    circuit and down-sampled by a factor of ``2 ** n_discard`` along each axis, so
    a ``P x P`` patch becomes a ``(P / 2**n_discard) x (P / 2**n_discard)`` patch.

    Parameters
        patch_size : ``int``\n
            Side length of the square patches, must be a power of two. The circuit
            uses ``2 * log2(patch_size)`` qubits, which is required to be in
            ``[4, 20]`` (i.e. ``patch_size`` in ``[4, 1024]``).
        wrap_H_layer : ``bool``, optional\n
            Whether to wrap the transform with Hadamard layers, as proposed in [1].
            The Hadamards reduce the statistical fluctuations of each pixel while
            preserving the contrast of the image, making the reconstruction faithful
            to the classical box down-sampling. Strongly recommended (Default: True).
        shots : ``int``, optional\n
            If given, the output probabilities are sampled with this many
            measurement shots (emulating finite-sampling noise on real hardware).
            If ``None`` (Default), the exact probabilities are used.
        seed : ``int``, optional\n
            Random seed used when ``shots`` is set (Default: None).
